The VTAM secondary operator facility allows you to enter VTAM commands and
receive the generated messages.  The VTAM command is entered on the command
line.  There are short forms of several VTAM commands:
%   D node    means  D NET,E,ID=node
    A node    means  V NET,ACT,ID= node
    I node    means  V NET,INACT,I,ID=node
    R node    means  V NET,INACT,R,ID=node
    F node    means  V NET,INACT,F,ID=node
    T node    means  F NET,TRACE,F,ID=node,TYPE=IO
    T node,x  means  F NET,TRACE,F,ID=node,TYPE=t   (x=B: t=BUF, x=L: t=LINE)
    N node    means  F NET,NOTRACE,F,ID=node   +
Setting the%SCREEN ROLL+parameter to 'NO' allows commands to be entered without
the display portion of the screen changing.  The%WAIT+parameter controls how
long the program waits after issueing a command before trying to display the
results.  This allows VTAM time to process the command.  All output from
commands must be processed before you can exit from this panel.  To display the
next screen of messages simply press the enter key without entering a command.
If the last command issued was a display command and there is no output waiting
then the display command will be reissued.  To see the command that was sent to
VTAM enter a "?".  Using a node of "*" will operate on the last node enterd.
